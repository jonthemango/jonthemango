## Hey!

My name is Jon Mongeau, welcome to my github.

## About Me
- I work as a senior software developer at [Bell Canada](https://www.bce.ca/) focusing on internal automation👨‍💻 tools for our cloud team.
- I graduated with a degree🎓 in Software Engineering from Concordia University 
- My programming language of choice is python🐍 with typescript being a close second.
- When I'm not working on cool stuff you can catch me playing volleyball🏐, going camping🏕️, or gaming🕹️ with friends

## My Work
In my time at BCE, I've had the oppurtunity to tackle many challenges and projects. Lately, I've been leading a team of 8 developers in building an internal firewall request automation platform. BCE's network is complex and enabling firewall traffic requires an operations team to do a lot of the heavy lifting for determining what policies to open and on which firewalls. Our dev team designed a new user intake process, an advanced routing algorithm to determine the firewall devices in the network path, and automatic grouping and writing of firewall policies on those firewalls. I learned a lot about leadership, networking and system design over the course of the last few years working on this project.

## Python

Like most, I can be a versatile developer but let's not pretend we all don't have preferences. I am first and foremost a python developer. I started learning python back in 2016 with python 3.5 and here I am almost a decade later (and 10 versions later) with a love for it. I learned python on the back of the book [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by [Al Sweigart](https://github.com/asweigart/). With this book I was a taught a practical approach to python as a tool for automating processes for my then IT job all while I studied more fundemental programming concepts in university. My approach to software development has changed considerably since then but in a lot of ways my early dev days with this book and python shape a lot of my ideas about programming; getting stuff done, focussing on value added work and building scrappy proof of concepts. I sometimes harken back to the old days of running my python script on an old 2007 Windows workstation acting as my server (with sleep mode turned off) when I'm writing CI yml files and toiling with my kubernetes pods to get probes correctly configured.

I've tried a couple of http server libraries but by far my favourite is [`fastapi`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). It's seamless integration with [`pydantic`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) and therefore the out-of-the-box swagger docs are among the reasons for this hype. In my opinion, it demands a minimal amount of code to get started while providing the most. The validation coming from the pydantic models cannot be understated.
